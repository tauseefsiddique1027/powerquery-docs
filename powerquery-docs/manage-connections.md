# Manage connections (Preview)

>[!NOTE]
>This feature is currently available only in Power Query Online and is in public preview.

With Power Query, you can [connect to a multitude of data sources](connectors/index.md). When you connect to a data source, you fundamentally create a connection to it. This connection consists of your data source, credentials, and more information, such as privacy levels and optional parameters for each data source. The **Manage connections** dialog is one centralized way in your Power Query project to manage the connections that are being referenced by your project.

The entry to the **Manage connections** dialog is available in the Power Query **Home tab** in the ribbon's **Data sources** group.

**Manage connections** displays a list of all connections being referenced in your Power Query project. It also notes the ability to disconnect from any of the connections in your project.

## Unlink a connection

Right next to the name of connection, and before the **Source type** column, there's an icon to disconnect the connection.

When you disconnect a connection, you're simply removing the reference of the connection from your project. This means that the definition of the connection isn't removed from the back-end and it can't be used in your project.

A new prompt then asks you to confirm that you want to disconnect the connection.

## Edit capability

Right next to the name of connection, and before the **Source type** column, there's an icon to edit the connection. 

Here, you can edit the following information about your connection:

* **Connection name:** This is the name that you can define to uniquely identify your connections. Note that you can't duplicate the name of a connection in your environment.
* **Data gateway:** If your data source requires a data gateway, select the gateway using the dropdown list from this field.
* **Authentication kind & credentials:** Depending on the connector, you're presented with multiple authentication kind options that are available to establish a connection, as well as fields where you enter your credentials. For this example, the Windows authentication kind has been selected and you can see the **Username** and **Password** fields that need to be filled in to establish a connection.

>[!NOTE]
>If you want to delete a connection from within a specific product integration, such as Microsoft Power BI or Microsoft Fabric, be sure to check out the documentation for each product on how a centralized connections portal can be used.
